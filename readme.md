# ChangeKit
 ChangeKit is a simple framework that integrates with your iOS and Android apps, along with your server, to make data usage efficient.
 
 **ChangeKit is a work in progress tool, and should not be deployed in production until specified in this README.**
 
 ChangeKit requires the `mysql` library. To initialize ChangeKit, simply:
 ```javascript
const changekit = require("changekit")(mysqlDatabase);
```

Again, this is a work in progress tool, and it should not be deployed to production until specified in this README. Check back soon for updates.
